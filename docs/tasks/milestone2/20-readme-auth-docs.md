# Task: Update README with auth guidance

## Summary
- Expand the project README to include setup and usage instructions for the new authentication system.
- Document environment variables, dev workflows, and testing steps related to auth.

**Status:** Pending — README still lacks JWT, OAuth, and seed-user guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README outlines how to configure JWT secrets and OAuth credentials for local and production environments.
- [ ] Instructions cover running migrations/seeds and performing basic auth smoke tests.
- [ ] Screenshots or references to auth UI added if applicable.

## Notes
- Cross-link to PRD/ADR sections for deeper architectural context.
- Ensure docs stay in sync with `.env.example` defaults and Docker instructions.
