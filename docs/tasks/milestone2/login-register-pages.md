# Task: Build login and registration pages

## Summary
- Create Next.js App Router pages for sign-in and sign-up with accessible, validated forms.
- Provide client-side and server-side validation feedback to users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/login` and `/register` routes exist with responsive layouts matching the design system.
- [ ] Forms perform validation (e.g., using Zod + react-hook-form) before submission and display errors inline.
- [ ] Successful submissions call the appropriate auth actions and navigate users accordingly.

## Notes
- Reuse shared UI primitives from shadcn/ui to maintain consistency.
- Include links between the two pages ("Already have an account?", etc.).
