# Task: Refresh PRD and ADRs for auth changes

## Summary
- Review PRD and ADR documents to capture the finalized authentication architecture and any deviations from original plans.
- Update diagrams or decision logs to reflect new flows (JWT, OAuth, NextAuth integration).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `docs/PRD.md` auth sections reflect the implemented features and user journeys.
- [ ] Relevant ADRs are amended or new ADRs added to document significant decisions.
- [ ] Any diagrams or sequence charts are updated or added to illustrate the auth lifecycle.

## Notes
- Coordinate with engineering leads to ensure documentation matches actual implementation choices.
- Highlight reasons for deviations (if any) to support future audits.
