# Task: Update docs for Kanban and tags

## Summary
- Refresh PRD/README to describe the Kanban experience, tag strategy, and optimistic update behavior.
- Add diagrams or screenshots that help stakeholders understand the new flows.

**Status:** New.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PRD includes Kanban goals, success metrics, and UX notes that mirror the shipped implementation.
- [ ] README gains setup/testing instructions for the board (e.g., enabling drag/drop in Docker, running the `.http` pack).
- [ ] Any new decisions about tags/board ordering are captured in an ADR amendment or a new ADR.

## Notes
- Link to the manual/automated test checklists so QA can validate Milestone 4 quickly.
- Consider embedding a lightweight mermaid sequence diagram for drag/drop + optimistic update lifecycle.
